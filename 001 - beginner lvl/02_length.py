--------

# 01. how to print length of string 'abcd'?

list = 'abcd'
print(len(list))

# 02. how to print length of the variable x if x is the list of [5,30,2]?

x = [5, 30, 2]
print(len(x))

# 03. what would be the length of following dictionary {'x': 3, 'y':3}?

random_dictionary =  {
  'x': 3,
  'y': 3,
}

print(len(random_dictionary))

# 04. What would be the length of the tuple ('x', 'y')

random_tuple = ('x', 'y')
print(len(random_tuple))
