# Write one line of code that will print "Hello World!"
# Now modify the code so the output looks like this:

# "Hello
#   World"


# this is how i solved it

first_part = 'Hello'
second_part = '  World'

print(first_part + second_part)


# this is the solution answer from the repo

print('Hello \n World')


# dev-reflection: looking at the actual answer, i've realized both work just fine but the repo solution is def easier for this particular question
